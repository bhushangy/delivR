# Deliver
Deliver is a Mobile Application that enables people to get essential items in need at their door step.
Unlike traditional e-commerce apps which is largely dominated by wholesale retailers and big players,
the aim of this application is to provide an oppurtunity for all kinds of sellers be it small or big who 
have set up stores near one's house (within a radius of 3 to 4 km only) to get into e-commerce.
In this kind of a decentralised system the consumer gets to buy his stuff from 
from the place he trusts in the shortest of time.
